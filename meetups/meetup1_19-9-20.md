## Agenda

- [x] **First person perspective(FPP)**
* The First Person Perspective is better known as how a person sees the world.
* Since we currently don't have the VR glasses as well as the sensors a discussion was conducted on how to tackle the issue. We brought several concepts such as 
  FPP, TPP and more. 
* Since FPP is more relatable to how we see things in VR, we decided the camera viewpoint should be in FPP.
