#### Time : 11:30 am to 12:15 pm

## Agenda

- [x] **First person perspective(FPP)**
* issue -  Due to non availability of VR glasses as well as the sensors, how do we build the mock industrial training in VR?
* discussion - Several concepts such as FPP, TPP etc.. were discussed. The First Person Perspective is better known as how a person sees the world.
* conclusion - Since FPP is more relatable to how we see things in VR, decided to make the camera viewpoint FPP.

- [x] **Which industry solution to implement?(general/specific)**

* issue - since different industrial training are dissimilar and often incompatible, which industry should we focus on?
* discussion - suggestions included airline industry, nuclear power plant, army training, chemical industry
* conclusion - more discussion and guidance from project coordinator needed

- [x] **Industrial Training Structure**

* issue - how to create an effectinve training program which can add value to the workforce?
* discussion - came up with 10 levels

      1. Initial Theoretical Training 
      2. Instructor Led Training - industry experts from from other places/countries can guide trainees 
      3. Systems Appreciation
      4. Fault Diagnostics Training
      5. Rectification Training
      6. Equipment Familiarisation 
      7. Scenarios Simulation
      8. Visual Appreciation
      9. Hand/Eye Coordination
      10. Spatial Appreciation

* conclusion - condensed it into 5 levels

      1. Initial Theoretical Training 
      2. Instructor Led Training - industry experts from from other places/countries can guide trainees 
      3. Systems Appreciation + Equipment Familiarisation + Spatial Appreciation
      4. Fault Diagnostics Training + Rectification Training 
      5. Scenarios Simulation + Hand/Eye Coordination + Visual Appreciation
