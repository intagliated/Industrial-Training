## Agenda

- [x] **First person perspective(FPP)**
* The First Person Perspective is better known as how a person sees the world.
* Since we currently don't have the VR glasses as well as the sensors a discussion was conducted on how to tackle the issue. We brought several concepts such as 
  FPP, TPP and more. 
* Since FPP is more relatable to how we see things in VR, we decided the camera viewpoint should be in FPP.

3. Systems Appreciation
4. Fault Diagnostics Training
5. Rectification Training
6. Equipment Familiarisation 
7. Scenarios Simulation
8. Visual Appreciation
9. Hand/Eye Coordination
10. Spatial Appreciation

* conclusion - condensed it into 5 levels

1. Initial Theoretical Training 
2. Instructor Led Training - industry experts from from other places/countries can guide trainees 
3. Systems Appreciation + Equipment Familiarisation + Spatial Appreciation
4. Fault Diagnostics Training + Rectification Training 
5. Scenarios Simulation + Hand/Eye Coordination + Visual Appreciation
